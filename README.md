# ToBeNamedPortfilio
This is will be a website that will act as an online portfolio/gallery.

### Requirements:
* TBD - need to discuss with the owner about this.

## --- Stack ---
* Authentication: (Researching)
  * Not sure yet if I need to worry about this, the back-end language may handle this just fine without needing some other program like Auth0.
* Front End: React, Ant.Design
  * I'm choosing React because I have some experience with it, but I want more practice. Ant.Design is just a component librarty for react, might use something else.
* Back End: Python? Ruby? C++? 
  * Still Researching which back end language to use here. This mostly falls to personal preference, so im looking mostly into python
* Database: Cassandra? MongoDB? MySQL? (Reasearching Options/Integration)
  * The database chosen is dependent on the support it has for the chosen backend language. SQL is preffered over NoSQL for this project.

* Docker for packaging/deploying the application. 
  * It seems easier to use and run than vagrant when hosting the app on on some hosting service (TBD).
* nginx as the app server - maybe? 
  * not sure if this is really required yet, but it may be a good idea to use it just in case.
* Need to look into different cloud hosting options... (most likely going to Heroku as its free)
