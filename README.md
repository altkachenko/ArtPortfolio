# ToBeNamedPortfilio
This is will be a website that will act as an online portfolio/gallery for someone I know.
The main purpose of this application, beyond the above reason, is to get more practice with front end technologies (React in this case), as well as the process of building, deploying, and hosting the application.

### Requirements:
* TBD - need to discuss with the owner about this.

## --- Stack ---
* Authentication: (Researching)
  * Not sure yet if I need to worry about this, the back-end language may handle this just fine without needing some other program like Auth0.
* Front End: React. I'm choosing React because I have some experience with it, but I want more practice, and to that end I will be building custom components.
* Back End: Ruby on Rails. Chose this because I have experience with it. The backend is not the point of this project. 
* Database: SQLite3 for development. Most Likely will try to use MySQL for production.

* Docker for packaging/deploying the application. 
  * It seems easier to use and run than vagrant when hosting the app on on some hosting service (TBD).
* nginx as the app server - maybe? 
  * not sure if this is really required yet, but it may be a good idea to use it just in case.
* Need to look into different cloud hosting options... (most likely going to Heroku as its free)
